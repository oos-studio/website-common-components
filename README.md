### A Library of Components for Building Websites with React.js

> `website-common-components` is finally open source! The communities help is requested to make this a more complete package.

Website Common Components provides a set of out of the box components that can be used as building blocks for common websites layouts. The goal is to make building simple react websites faster, and the vision is for a community of themes/templates to be built on top. 

## Installation 

Please note that Website Common Components is currently an alpha. To install using `yarn`:

```
yarn add @oos-studio/website-common-components
```

## Components

Available components can be found under `src/components`

## Samples

Some sample projects can be found under `src/samples`. Please note that these samples where taken from troubleshooting projects used for building three production ready websites. As a result, they may not appear complete or could contain bugs.

You can view the websites built with Website Common Components below:
